# Deployment and DevOps for MERN Applications

This assignment focuses on deploying a full MERN stack application to production, implementing CI/CD pipelines, and setting up monitoring for your application.

## Assignment Overview

You will:
1. Prepare your MERN application for production deployment
2. Deploy the backend to a cloud platform
3. Deploy the frontend to a static hosting service
4. Set up CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions
5. Implement monitoring and maintenance strategies

## Getting Started

1. Accept the GitHub Classroom assignment invitation
2. Clone your personal repository that was created by GitHub Classroom
3. Follow the setup instructions in the `Week7-Assignment.md` file
4. Use the provided templates and configuration files as a starting point

## Files Included

- `Week7-Assignment.md`: Detailed assignment instructions
- `PRODUCTION_OPTIMIZATION_CHECKLIST.md`: Step 2 - Backend and frontend optimizations completed
- `MONGODB_ATLAS_SETUP.md`: Complete guide for MongoDB Atlas configuration
- `RENDER_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`: Comprehensive Render backend deployment guide
- `RENDER_QUICK_START.md`: 5-minute quick start for Render deployment
- `render.yaml`: Infrastructure-as-code configuration for Render
- `app/`: Your complete MERN application (client + server)
- `.env.example` files: Configuration templates for both frontend and backend

## Requirements

- A completed MERN stack application from previous weeks
- Accounts on the following services:
  - GitHub
  - MongoDB Atlas
  - Render, Railway, or Heroku (for backend)
  - Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages (for frontend)
- Basic understanding of CI/CD concepts

## Deployment Platforms

### Backend Deployment Options
- **Render**: Easy to use, free tier available
- **Railway**: Developer-friendly, generous free tier
- **Heroku**: Well-established, extensive documentation

### Frontend Deployment Options
- **Vercel**: Optimized for React apps, easy integration
- **Netlify**: Great for static sites, good CI/CD
- **GitHub Pages**: Free, integrated with GitHub

## CI/CD Pipeline

The assignment includes templates for setting up GitHub Actions workflows:
- `frontend-ci.yml`: Tests and builds the React application
- `backend-ci.yml`: Tests the Express.js backend
- `frontend-cd.yml`: Deploys the frontend to your chosen platform
- `backend-cd.yml`: Deploys the backend to your chosen platform

## Submission

Your work will be automatically submitted when you push to your GitHub Classroom repository. Make sure to:

1. Complete all deployment tasks
2. Set up CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions
3. Deploy both frontend and backend to production
4. Document your deployment process in the README.md
5. Include screenshots of your CI/CD pipeline in action
6. Add URLs to your deployed applications

## Deployment Progress Tracker

### ✅ Completed Steps

**Step 1: Prerequisites Setup**
- Accounts created on GitHub, MongoDB Atlas, Render, and Vercel
- MERN application ready for deployment

**Step 2: Production Optimization**
- ✅ Backend security enhancements (Helmet, Morgan)
- ✅ Error handling and graceful shutdown
- ✅ Frontend production build optimization
- ✅ Code splitting and minification configured
- ✅ Environment variables configured
- ✅ Production build successfully created

**Step 3: Backend Deployment to Render** ✅
- ✅ Backend successfully deployed to Render
- ✅ URL: https://mern-chat-backend-nqem.onrender.com
- ✅ Socket.io server running
- ✅ Monitoring and logs accessible

### 📋 Current Step: Step 4 - Frontend Deployment to Vercel

**To Deploy Frontend:**
1. Read `VERCEL_QUICK_START.md` for 5-minute setup
2. Or read `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions
3. Connect GitHub repository to Vercel
4. Set root directory to `app/client`
5. Add environment variable: `VITE_SOCKET_URL=https://mern-chat-backend-nqem.onrender.com`
6. Deploy!

**Expected Outcome:** Frontend running at `https://your-frontend.vercel.app`

### 🔄 Next Steps

- Step 4: Frontend Deployment to Vercel

## 🔧 CI/CD Pipeline

### GitHub Actions Workflows

| Workflow | Status | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Backend CI | ✅ Passing | Test backend on push/PR |
| Backend CD | ✅ Passing | Auto-deploy to Render |
| Frontend CI | ❌ Failing | Test frontend on push/PR |
| Frontend CD | ❌ Failing | Auto-deploy to Vercel |

### Pipeline Features
- Automated testing on push to main/develop branches
- Automatic deployment to production on main branch merges
- Security audits and dependency checks
- Health checks after deployment

## 📊 Monitoring & Health

The application includes comprehensive monitoring:

### Health Endpoints
- `GET /api/health` - Application health status
- `GET /api/metrics` - Performance metrics

### Health Check Response Example
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "uptime": 123.45,
  "memory": {
    "rss": "45.23 MB",
    "heapTotal": "12.34 MB",
    "heapUsed": "8.76 MB"
  },
